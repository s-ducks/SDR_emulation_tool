# SDR_emulation_tool

This tool has been built to emulate the SDR data sent between OBS -> TMC (MS)<br><br>

It comes with two files: <br>
<t>PacketMaker.py <br>
<t>sdr.yml <br><br>

PacketMaker.py drives the creation of a packet every ~200ms <br>
sdr.yml is the packet configuration file used for this particular packet.<br>
The program can be configured to create a packet of any kind in this format <br><br>

This is in pre-alpha state.
