# SDR_emulation_tool

This tool has been built to emulate the SDR data sent between OBS -> TMC (MS)

It comes with two files:
  PacketMaker.py
  sdr.yml

PacketMaker.py drives the creation of a packet every ~200ms 
sdr.yml is the packet configuration file used for this particular packet.
The program can be configured to create a packet of any kind in this format

This is in pre-alpha state.
